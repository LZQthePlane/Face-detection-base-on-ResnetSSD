# Face detection base on ResnetSSD
Project of Face detection using Resnet and SSD, apply in image and webcam.   
(The code comments are descibed in chinese)

------
## ***Folder Intro***
### —test_out
The result of my test in webcam.

### —openh264-XXX.dll
A *.dll* required to run on video-mode and to save it as *.mp4* if using **Windows** platform.

### —Resnet_SSD_deploy/Res10_300x300_SSD_iter_140000.caffemodel
Files save the pre-trained SSD-Resnet caffe model. 
   .prototxt file which specifies the architecture of the neural network – how the different layers are arranged etc.
   .caffemodel file which stores the weights of the trained model
OpenCV’s deep learning face detector is based on the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework with a ResNet base network (*unlike other OpenCV SSDs that you may have seen which typically use MobileNet as the base network).*
